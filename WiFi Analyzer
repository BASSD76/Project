 for the Wi-Fi Network Analyzer experiments, setup the network analyzer app and test its functions. Then conduct the measurements and record the device’s internal and external IP addresses and gateway’s IP address, link data rate that the AP provides, PHY channel and bandwidth you are using, number of detectable Wi-Fi channel signals and the strongest and weakest signal strength detected. In addition, conduct a Ping to the gateway and record the results.
